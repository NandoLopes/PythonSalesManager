# PythonSalesManager
Simple console application for sales management using Python, and storing data using SQLite

## Run application
To run the application, simply follow the instructions on the latest release.

## About the code
- The database already has a few data for tests. If you wish to use your own data, just open the db file using the [SQLite Broswer](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
- Since the application was built for a business case, there are a few features missing, such as adding/deleting sellers (if you wish to use this application for personal use, you need to change the name of the sellers using the SQLite Browser)
- At the moment, there is no separate table for the products
- The application was built in one day for a guy that had almost no knowledge on Python, everything was created used the logic obtained on previous jobs (.NET, Angular)
- The idea was to build the requested application with as little as possible (no Regex, dataclasses, etc)
- Since it's a product of a 1 day build, there are some code smells. In the future I may come back to reorganize, and solve some known problems on the code/optimization
